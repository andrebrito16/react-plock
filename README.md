```tsx
const ImagesMasonry = () => {
  const items = [...imageUrls];

  return (
    <Masonry
      items={items}
      config={{ columns: [1, 2, 3], media: [640, 768, 1024] }}
      render={(item, idx) => (
        <div key={idx} style={{ width: "100%" }}>
          <img src={item} style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} />
        </div>
      )}
    />
  );
};
```

### API Reference

Here's the TypeScript definition for the Masonry Component, below you can find a more detailed explanation.

```ts
export type MasonryProps<T> = {
  items: T[];
  render: (item: T, idx: number) => React.ReactNode;
  config?: {
    columns?: number | number[];
    media?: number[];
  };
};
```

#### Items

This prop accepts a generic array of elements, each one will be passed to the **render** property.

#### Render

The masonry render prop. Here's where you define the styles of every tile of the grid, the function takes the current looping item and the relative index.

#### Config

A configuration object that is used to define the number of columns, media queries and other stuff.

### Important Note

Please, note that in case you are passing an array to the columns attribute of the config property, the number of elements **MUST** be equal to the number of media breakpoints provided!

```tsx
// Correct: This will be responsive with 3 breakpoints.
<Masonry
  config={{
    columns: [1, 2, 3],
    media: [640, 768, 1024],
  }}
/>

// Correct: This will be responsive with 2 breakpoints.
<Masonry
  config={{
    columns: [1, 2],
    media: [640, 1024],
  }}
/>

// Correct: This will be fixed with 4 columns in every screen size.
<Masonry
  config={{
    columns: 4,
  }}
/>

// NOT Correct: This will cause trouble in rendering.
<Masonry
  config={{
    columns: [4],
    media: [640, 768],
  }}
/>
```
